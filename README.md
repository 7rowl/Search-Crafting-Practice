# Search Crafting Practice Map
Inspired by Semperz' and Fyroah's crafting practice map. 

Built specifically for search crafting, but can be used as regular crafting practice as well. 

The main difference betweent this map and others, is that it gives you a goal item to craft in infinite loop of them, instead of set inventory and order how other practice maps do.

**If certain crafts happen too often for you, and you want to lower them or increase others, you can fly out in spectator and change the amount of armor stands on each item by spawning armor stand and doing /tag add r**
